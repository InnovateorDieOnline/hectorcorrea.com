    <h1>Welcome to HectorCorrea.com</h1>

    <p>I am a Software Developer in State College, PA.</p>

    <p>This site is where I host <a href="http://hectorcorrea.com/Blog">my blog</a> and post small articles about software development as well as code samples.</p>

    <p>My main areas of interest are web development in small and collaborative teams. Although my main expertise is with C# and the .NET platform, I enjoy learning and using a variety of technologies including Ruby, Rails, CoffeeScript, and Node.js and therefore the posts in this site cover a wide range of topics. </p>

    <p>Feel free to browse around and contact me at <a href="mailto:hector@hectorcorrea.com">hector@hectorcorrea.com</a> if you have any questions or comments.</p>
