<p>In this blog post I show how to use CSS and jQuery to slide-in a panel 
full page on top of another and then slide back in the original content.</p>

<p>You can see a running version of the code presented in this blog 
post <a href="http://hectorcorrea.com/downloads/slide-in-panel-sample.html" target="_blank">here</a>. 
This demo page starts with a panel showing some part of the
Lorem Ipsum text. When you click on the text a new panel
displaying the Bacon Ipsum text slides-in on top of the previous text. 
Clicking on the new text slides the Lorem Ipsum back again. Nothing 
fancy but enough to show the slide-in functionality in a full page panel.</p>

<h2>The HTML</h2>

<p>The HTML used in this example is basically composed of two HTML divs. 
The first div (called <b>mainDiv</b>) includes the Lorem Ipsum text while the second div
(called <b>galleryDiv</b>) includes the Bacon Ipsum.</p>

<p><code><div id="mainDiv">Lorem Impsum text goes here</div></code></p>

<p><code><div id="galleryDiv">Bacon ipsum text goes here</div></code></p>

<h2>The CSS</h2>

<p>The CSS to style these two divs is shown below. As you can see they are just plain 
divs using fixed positioning. The main difference between both styles is the background 
color (the mainDiv is beige and the galleryDiv is a tone of red.) Notice that initially the mainDiv
is set to use all the real state (height and width are set to 100%).</p>

<h2>The jQuery Code</h2>

<p>The basics of the jQuery code to slide-in the one panel on top of another
were taken from the excellent <br />
<a href="http://tympanus.net/codrops/2010/05/14/sliding-panel-photo-wall-gallery-with-jquery/" target="_blank">Sliding Panel Photo Wall Gallery with jQuery</a> example by Mary Lou
at Codrops. I’ve simplified the code to make it easier to see what it takes to 
slide-in content on top of another back and forth.</p>

<p>When the page first loads we force the mainDiv to be visible and the galleryDiv invisible.</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1384845.js?file=gistfile1.js"></script>

<p>The next thing we do is to wire the <strong>mainDiv</strong> so that when the user clicks
on it we slide-in the galleryDiv. The code for this is very simple too:</p>

<script src="https://gist.github.com/1263374.js"> </script>
<noscript> <a href="https://gist.github.com/1263374.js>View code</a></noscript>

<p>This code does the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>Pushes the mainDiv to the back by setting its z-index to zero.</li>
<li>Pops the galleryDiv to the front by setting its z-index to 
something greater than zero, in our case to 100.</li>
<li>Sets the height of the galleryDiv to 100% using an animation 
(so that the slide-in effect is noticeable.)</li>
<li>Finally we collapse the mainDiv by setting its height to zero. 
This allows us to animate it when we slide-in back again.</li>
</ol>

<p>The code to wire the <strong>galleryDiv</strong> to do the reverse is also very simple:</p>

<h2 id="andthatsit">And that’s it</h2>

<p>With just a few of lines of code we can easily 
slide-in content in our web pages. You can see this code running
in <a href="http://hectorcorrea.com/downloads/slide-in-panel-sample.html" target="_blank">this link</a>. 
The page is self contained. View source and grab the code if you like it. </p>

<p><b>Update:</b> A previous version of this code used the wrong kind of positioning on the mainDiv and galleryDiv styles and that resulted in weird behaviors when sliding content back and forth if the text was longer than what fits on the page (e.g. if the browser window was resized to be smaller than the text.) The current version that you are reading addresses this issue.</p>
