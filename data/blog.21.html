<p>A few months ago I decided write a C# program to handle binary trees. I was lucky to still remember some of the basics of this data structure from my college days and was able to write a program to handle the add operation and the code to "walk the tree" in a few hours. To make things more interesting I also decided to write a program to draw the binary tree on the screen. This turned out to be an interesting challenge and kept me busy for a few weeks.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px">The <a href="http://downloads.hectorcorrea.com/DataStructures.zip">source code for this program is here</a>. This version uses generics so it can be used with any type that implements the IComparable interface.</p>

<p>A binary tree, as indicated in <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree">Wikipedia</a>, is a tree data structure in which each node has at most two children. To implement this data structure I created two classes: <strong>BinaryTreeNode</strong><t></t> and <strong>BinaryTree</strong><t></t>. The former is used to represent each node while the later is used to organize the nodes following the rules of binary trees. In addition, I created a third class <strong>BinaryTreeDrawer</strong><t></t> that implements the algorithm to actually draw a binary tree on the screen and let you <em>see </em>how the information is organized.</p>

<p dir="ltr" style="margin-right: 0px"><em>A word of caution.</em> Although in production environments tree structures are used to optimize access to information the classes that I am providing here were not implemented with performance and optimization in mind. These classes are meant to showcase how binary trees are organized internally and allow people <em>to see them</em>.</p>

<p>The demo program allows you to add values to a binary tree and see how the tree looks graphically. For example, below is the graphical representation that it generates when the following values are added to a binary tree: 100, 50, 150, 25, 75, 12, 40, 60, and 90.</p>

<p>It is interesting to see how trees with random values look on the screen when hundreds of nodes are added to them. Click <a target="_blank" href="/downloads/binarytree200nodes.png">here</a> if you want to see a binary tree with 200+ random nodes (180 KB.)</p>

<p>With any luck I'll post an updated version in the next few weeks that will include the find and delete operation. My real goal is to post a program to represent <strong>B-Trees</strong> and <strong>B<sup>+</sup>-Trees</strong> in C# (which are the kings of the trees) and that a lot of people confuse with binary trees. Stay tuned.</p>
