<p>A few days ago I configured Sublime Text 2 editor to use three different hotkeys for compiling and running CoffeeScript files. I am new to Sublime so I consider somewhat of an achievement that I was able to pull this off with help from the interwebz and a bit of luck.</p>

<h2>Run a CoffeeScript file in the Sublime console</h2>
<p>The first hotkey that I configured runs a CoffeeScript file and displays its output to the Sublime’s console window. This is useful when I want to quickly run a small CoffeeScript program that outputs to the console. The following screenshot shows this:</p>

<p><img src="http://downloads.hectorcorrea.com/images/sublimetextconsole.png"/></p>

<p>To wire up this hotkey I created a new <i>Build System</i> for CoffeeScript files. You can do this via the Tools + Build System + New Build System menu option. Copy the following code inside the editor and save it as CoffeeScriptRun.sublime-build in the default directory (in my Mac the path was ~/Library/Application Support/Sublime Text 2/Packages/User)</p> 

<p>For Mac</p>

<pre class="code">{
    "cmd": ["coffee", "$file"],
    "selector" : "source.coffee",
    "path" : "/usr/local/bin"
}
</pre>

<p>For Windows</p>

<pre class="code">{
    "cmd": ["coffee", "$file"],
    "selector" : "source.coffee"
}
</pre>

<p>From now on, when I hit <b>command+B</b> (⌘+B) while editing a CoffeeScript file, Sublime automatically calls the CoffeeScript compiler with the current opened file. Command+B is the default key in Sublime Text to run the build command. You can also run this command from the menu by going to Tools + Build. The output of the CoffeeScript will be displayed in the Sublime Text console at the bottom of the screen.</p>

<h2>Generate the JavaScript file for a CoffeeScript file</h2>

<p>The second command that I configured was to re-generate the JavaScript file associated with a CoffeeScript file. </p>

<p>One easy way to do this is to create another build file like I did above but use a slightly different command to tell the CoffeeScript compiler to produce a JavaScript file. The disadvantage of this approach is that then I have to toggle between build modes via the Tools + Build System and then use command+B to produce the JavaScript file. This is just too many steps for something that I need to do quite often.</p>

<p>What I really wanted was a hotkey to re-generate the JavaScript file in one shot. To do this I had to create a new key binding (Sublime Text wording for hotkey) by going to the Sublime Text 2 + Preferences + Key bindings - User and entering the following text:</p> 

<pre class="code">
[
    { "keys": ["super+j"], "command": "coffeescript_to_javascript" }
]
</pre>

<p>This tells Sublime to wire the <b>command+J</b> key to a command called “coffeescript_to_javascript”. The next step is to create the code associated with “coffeescript_to_javascript”. To do this I went to Tools + New Plugin... menu and replaced the default code with the following: </p>

<pre class="code">
import sublime, sublime_plugin

class CoffeescriptToJavascript(sublime_plugin.TextCommand):
  def run(self, edit):
    self.view.window().run_command('exec', {'cmd': ["coffee", "-c", self.view.file_name()]})
</pre>

<p>Two things to notice in this code. One is that the name of the class (CoffeescriptToJavascript) is the CamelCase version of the name of the command (“coffeescript_to_javascript”) that I defined in the key bindings. This is very important as Sublime will automatically look for a class with the CamelCase version for the value defined in the key bindings.</p> 

<p>I wish I could remember where I stole the idea for this code, I know it was somewhere in the <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/forum/" target="_blank">Sublime message board</a> but I didn’t save the link.</p>

<p>The second thing to notice is that the run command in this code is calling the CoffeeScript compiler (coffee) and passing both the -c flag to produce the JavaScript and the name of the file to compile (which will be the name of the current file being edited.) </p>

<p>I saved this plugin file as CoffeeScriptCompile.py in the same location where you saved the build file that we created before. I restarted Sublime to make sure the new plugin was loaded. </p>

<p>From now on, when I use <b>command+J</b> Sublime runs “coffee -c somefile.coffee” and generates the corresponding somefile.js file. This command does not output the result to the console, though. </p>

<h2>Outputting the JavaScript code to the Sublime Console</h2>
<p>Lastly, using the steps defined in the previous section I created another plugin to output the JavaScript to Sublime’s console rather than to a file. This is very useful when I want to dig and see how a particular CoffeeScript feature is translated to its JavaScript equivalent. </p>

<p>I wired this command to the <b>command+M</b> key and pass the “-p” flag to the CoffeeScript compiler to get the JavaScript to the standard output.</p>
