<p><img width="120" height="62" hspace="5" align="left" alt="" src="http://downloads.hectorcorrea.com/images/pivottable.jpg" />A few years ago I wrote an article for the <a target="_blank" href="http://utmag.com">Universal Thread Magazine</a> on how to create reports using Excel's Pivot Tables. The article was titled <strong>Programming Rubber Band Reports with Pivot Tables</strong> and showed how to create Excel Pivot Tables from a Visual FoxPro (VFP) application. </p>

<p>Although the article is more than 6 years old I still get questions every now and then about the code samples that I mentioned in the article. The code samples mentioned in the article can be found at <a href="http://downloads.hectorcorrea.com/correa_pivottablesvfp.zip">http://downloads.hectorcorrea.com/correa_pivottablesvfp.zip</a> A VB.NET version of the code can be found at <a href="http://downloads.hectorcorrea.com/pivottable.zip">http://downloads.hectorcorrea.com/pivottable.zip</a></p>

<p>A PDF version of the article can also be found <a target="_blank" href="http://downloads.hectorcorrea.com/correapivottableswhitepaper.pdf">here</a>.</p>
